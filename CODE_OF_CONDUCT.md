# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Quantum Portfolio Optimizer project
pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, welcoming, and
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or
invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Behaviour that contributes to a positive environment includes:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and
  learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Unacceptable behaviour includes conduct that would reasonably be considered
inappropriate in a professional setting: personal attacks, political provocation,
publishing others' private information without permission, or any form of
discrimination or intimidation.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards and
will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with
this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of
representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an
official social-media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online
or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported
to the project maintainers at the repository's GitHub Issues page, or directly to the
maintainer(s) listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining consequences for any
action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

**1. Correction** — A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of
the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public
apology may be requested.

**2. Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction
with the people involved for a specified period of time, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. Violating these terms may lead
to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time.

**4. Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.
